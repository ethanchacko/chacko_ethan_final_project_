# Create a Pong Game in Python - Pygame â€“ GeeksforGeeks
# Mr.Cozort(Cris Cozort)
# My Father(Chacko, Antony) 


# Goals:
# I want to make the game modular (Completed: Arguably the most important)
# Fixing the glitching(Completed)
# Adding Variables to make the game more interesting:
    # Made the Ball Accelerate upon each time it collides with one of the players(Completed)
    # Making the Player be able to choose where the want to hit the ball(Not yet)
    # Have the Computer also decides where is hits the Ball(Not Yet)
    # Change the color palet and look of the game(Not Yet: In its current state I feel like Black and White is best)
# Change the game from Pong to Tennis:(Not Yet)
    # Change the screen dimensions
    # Make a tennis court
    # Make it so that the ball can be hit out of bounds
